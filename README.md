# Docker Project: Docker Composer

This is one of the projects provided by JetBrains Academy, a platform for studying programming languages.

This project builds an API with simple endpoint for creating tasks.
The main source for the API was not built by me, but provided by the JetBrains course.

## Objectives

The objective of the project was to learn how to:

- Create and update a docker-compose.yaml file;
- Understand the usage of a Dockerfile;
- Deploy this simple application to a container using Docker;

## Structure

The main files of interest are available at:

- .\Composer\task\task-manager

Files on other directories were automatically created by the course.
